Description:
I basically followed the heuristic given in the hint, and implemented with the pseudocode in the textbook. I tested my playerAI versus random ComputerAI, and tested my ComputerAI versus random playerAI. In each test they play three games against their opponents. 

Maximum tile values for the tests are shown below:
My playerAI vs. random ComputerAI: 1024, 2048, 1024
My ComputerAI vs. random PlayerAI: 128, 64, 64
